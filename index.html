                <h3>The journey towards a great future.</h3>
 
                <p>Started out with the love of tech by delving into Computer Science in a Nigerian
        Institution yet came out in 2015 with no practical knowledge of programming due to
        the nature of what the school entails. Started with freecodecame & codeacademy after higher
        institution but lost interest on the way.
                </p>
      
                <p>Got married in 2016 then went into a one month internship as a social media
        marketer in 2017. Then another one month code camp on becoming a Full Stack Developer early
        in 2018, then finished her NYSC in Dec of that year. She was really set on fire but with no
        mentor,the fire died easily since it wasn't easy to be self motivated on this path &
        perform wifely/motherly duties.
                </p>
      
                <p>After some time, Peace started some online courses trying to build herself up
        while the motivation is back in 2019. Used some youtube videos, goes back & forth on
        freecodecame, sololearn, udemy etc. She then went for another 3 months internship which
        ended Dec, 2019.
                </p>
    
                <p>This internship was what gave her the actual direction & a living fire that she needed.
      January, 2020, pave for her in her first mentorship program, on becoming a real software
      enginner, which she combined with getting to understanding the world of UI/UX. It has been
      mind blowing although overwhelming sometimes but fortunately, it has dawn on her that every
      pain & struggle will be worth it.
